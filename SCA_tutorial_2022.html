## The reproducibility crisis

.pull-left[

* Attempted to replicate 100 published studies based on the original materials using high powered designs

* The mean replication effect size was **half the magnitude** (*M* = 0.20, *SD* = 0.26)

* **36%** of replication results were statistically significant (versus 97% of the original studies)

* **39%** of the replications were subjectively rated as replicating the original result

## Specification curve analysis (SCA)

--

According to [Simonsohn, Simmons, &amp; Nelson, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0912-z), the solution is to specify all "reasonable" models to test an association and assess the joint distribution across model specifications.

--

&lt;br&gt;
.small[
&gt; Some researchers object to blindly running alternative specifications that may make little sense for theoretical or statistical reasons just for the sake of â€˜robustnessâ€™... We believe one should test specifications that vary in as many of the potentially ad hoc assumptions as possible without testing any specifications that are not theoretically grounded.
]

--

&lt;br&gt;
This can be thought of as an explicit framework for sensitivity analyses / robustness checks, that enables inferential statistics across model specifications.


---
## The value

Increased transparency.

--

A better understanding of how conceptual and analytic decisions alter the association of interest.

--

A more robust scientific literature with **increased replicability, generalizability, and translational value**.

## SCA overview

--
### 1. Specify all reasonable models

--

### 2. Plot specification curve showing association/effect estimates as a function of decisions

--

### 3. Test how inconsistent the curve results are given the null hypothesis of no association/effect

---

## 1. Identify reasonable models
For the relationship of interest, determine the set of reasonable model specifications to test.

--

#### Reasonable specifications should be:
+ Consistent with theory
+ Expected to be statistically valid
+ Non-redundant

## 1. Identify reasonable models

**Type E decisions**  
* Alternative specifications are expected to be **equivalent** and thus can be treated as arbitrary
* Include in the SCA

**Type N decisions**  
* Alternative specifications **non-equivalent** (e.g. due to lower reliability or validity) and therefore some specifications can be treated as objectively better justified
* Don't include clearly worse specifications in the SCA

**Type U decisions**  
* It is **uncertain** whether alternative specifications are non-equivalent
* Treat SCA as exploratory
* Potentially break into separate curves when estimating curve stats

## 2. Descriptive specification curve
The specification curve visualizes the strength of the association/effect between two constructs of interest across model specifications and the analytic decisions associated with each model specification.

.pull-left[
**Key features**
* Two panels depicting 1) the curve and 2) the decisions
* A vertical slice = information about a single model specification

## 2. Descriptive specification curve

--

#### The curve
* Model specifications are ranked

--

* Shows the model magnitude, sign (positive or negative), and statistical significance

--

* Often visualizes uncertainty around individual point estimates in the model specifications

--

* May highlight a single a priori or previously reported association/effect estimates

--

#### The decisions

--

* Each row denotes a specific decision and whether or not that decision applied to a given model specification

--

* Decisions are often grouped into categories to ease interpretation

## 3. Inferential statistics
&lt;br&gt;
#### Metrics of interest in the observed curve

* Median curve estimate

--

* The share of positive or negative associations that are statistically significant

###But are the observed effects surprising given the null hypothesis?
]

---

## 3. Inferential statistics
#### Test inconsistency with the null

--

+ Use bootstrap resampling to create a distribution of curves under the null hypothesis

--

  + Experimental designs = shuffle the randomly assigned variable(s)
  
--

  + Observational designs = "force" the null by removing the effect of x on y for each observation and sample from this null dataset
  
--

+ Estimate the curve and extract the curve median, and share of positive/negative significant associations

--

+ Repeat many times to get a distribution 

--

+ Compare observed curve metrics to null curves to generate p-values

---
## 3. Inferential statistics
#### Potential questions to test versus null

--

+ Is the median effect size in the observed curve statistically different than in the null distribution?

--

+ Is the share of dominant signs (e.g., positive or negative effects) that are statistically significant different than the null?

## 1. Define reasonable specifications
--

Ways of operationalizing of the IV "mental health"
* `CEDS10` = depression score on the CESD-10
* `GAD7` = anxiety score on the GAD-7
* `PANAS_negative_Affect` = negative affect score on the PANAS
* `PSS` = perceived stress score on the PSS

--

Control variables
* `age` = age
* `gender` = gender 
* `mother_edu` = maternal education

--

Analytic decisions
* Statistical modeling approach
  * Linear regression
* Outliers
  * Use all data points
  * Winsorize to the mean +/- 3 SD

## 2. Specify and estimate models

There are various methods for running a large number of model specifications.

&lt;br&gt;

Here, we'll look at one method using `{specr}`, but there are additional examples using `{MuMIn}` and `{purrr}` in the tutorial `.Rmd file`.

---

## Estimate models using `{specr}`

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[info]

#### Advantages
* Very simple to use!
* You can easily run the models in specific subsets of your data 

#### Disadvantages / limitations
* Need to adapt functions for deeper customization
]

.panel[.panel-name[code]

```r
dvs = "SWLS"
ivs = c("CESD10", "GAD7", "PANAS_negative_affect", "PSS",
        "CESD10_winsorized", "GAD7_winsorized", "PANAS_negative_affect_winsorized", "PSS_winsorized")
control_vars = c("age", "gender", "mother_edu")
model = "lm"
output_specr = run_specs(df = model_df,
                         y = dvs,

## 4. Inferential statistics

1. Run the SCA and extract the median, and the number of positive and negative statistically significant models

--

2. Use bootstrap resampling to create a distribution of curves under the null hypothesis

--

3. Generate p-values indicating how surprising the observed results are under the null hypothesis

---

## Null boostrap resampling

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[overview]

* Run SCA to retrieve associations between the independent and dependent variable in each model specification

* Extract the dataset for each model specification (which was saved as a model object `fit` in the data frame)

* Force the null on each specification by subtracting the effect of the independent variable of interest (b estimate * x) from the dependent variable (y_value) for each observation in the dataset

* For each bootstrap, sample with replacement from the null dataset and run all model specifications to generate a curve

* Extract median estimate, N positive &amp; significant at p &lt; .05, and N negative &amp; significant p &lt; .05

* Repeat process many times (e.g. 500 or 1000)

]
.panel[.panel-name[define functions]
* `run_boot_null` = wrapper function to run the bootstrapping procedure or load an existing output file

* `sca_boot_null` = function that runs the boostrapping procedure

* `summarize_sca` = function to summarize the observed specification curve

* `summarize_boot_null` = function to summarize the bootstrapped curves
